# Zero to Production in Go

## Why this Go guide?

I’ve been dipping my toes into Go lately, and I've noticed a gap in the learning resources. Coming from Rust, it has a wealth of excellent guides and tutorials, Go’s landscape is a bit more barren, especially when it comes to practical, production-ready applications for **beginners**.

So, I'm writing this guide to share what I've learned and to help others level up their Go skills. We'll cover everything from the basics to advanced topics, including:

* Building APIs: Designing, testing, and securing RESTful APIs.
* Data Persistence: Working with SQL and NoSQL databases.
* Monitoring and Logging: Implementing effective telemetry solutions.
* Deployment Strategies: Deploying Go applications to production environments.
* Error Handling and Debugging: Mastering Go's error handling mechanisms.

I'm no expert in Go, so this guide will be updated regularly when techniques or patterns are made avail to me. I hope this resource will help you become a more proficient Go developer.
